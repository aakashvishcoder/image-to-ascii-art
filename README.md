# Image to Ascii Art Generator

## General Process & Overview

<p>ASCII Art has always been quite fascinating to me. I've seen countless pictures that have been recreated by using ASCII characters, and I wanted to recreate an application using code to do just that. As a result, the idea for creating this application was born.</p>

<p>To create this application, I had to learn how to use the React framework to create the frontend portion of this project. Using NPM, I was able to create a React app, as NPM gave me a React template to edit. From there, I pieced the different portions of the project together by connecting the React file with the JavaScript file, then connecting that to the CSS and HTML files. In the future, I will consider publishing this on a website, once I spruce up the CSS. </p>
